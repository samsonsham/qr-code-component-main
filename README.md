## My process

- Define all the styles given by style guide, including colours and font into SCSS file.
- Setup DOM structure in HTML file (container, heading, paragraph).
- Paint the elements in SCSS
- Adjust size and alignment of elements

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Every time I do vertical alignment, CSS won't make me disappointed by not working at first ðŸ™ƒ. This challenge has reminded me that after applying 'align-items' property to flex container, it won't work unless I define its height. Another thing is that when I added 'height: 100vh' to the container, there would be an unwanted vertical scroll. I have to reset the margin and padding in order to get rid of it.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

### Useful Resources

These 2 articles give me the ideas of structure my scss files in my project:

- [Structuring your Sass Projects](https://itnext.io/structuring-your-sass-projects-c8d41fa55ed4)
- [2 SMARTEST WAYS TO STRUCTURE SASS](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2020/12/2-smartest-ways-to-structure-sass/)

I learnt the concept of BEM from this article which guide me to build a well structured DOM:

- [BEM Document](https://en.bem.info/methodology/quick-start/#block)

I learnt to use main tag from this article:

- [What is the purpose of the <main> tag in HTML?](https://dev.to/srijan1709/what-is-the-purpose-of-the-main-tag-in-html-3hno)

This article answered my question of using classes without any CSS style behind.
