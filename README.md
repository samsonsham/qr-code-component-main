- Adjust size and alignment of elements

- SCSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Every time I do vertical alignment, CSS won't make me disappointed by not working at first ðŸ™ƒ. This challenge has reminded me that after applying 'align-items' property to flex container, it won't work unless I define its height. Another thing is that when I added 'height: 100vh' to the container, there would be an unwanted vertical scroll. I have to reset the margin and padding in order to get rid of it.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```
